            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>Cancer treatment is rapidly evolving, with new therapies and clinical trials emerging constantly. However, one of the significant hurdles in cancer care is the difficulty in matching patients with the most suitable clinical trials. Healthcare providers are often overwhelmed by the sheer volume of available trials, each with its own eligibility criteria and protocols. This leads to missed opportunities for patients to access potentially life-saving treatments. Additionally, the manual process of matching patients with trials is time-consuming and prone to errors, delaying the initiation of crucial treatments and impacting patient outcomes.</p>
